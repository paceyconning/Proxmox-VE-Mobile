## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Hedgehog or later
- Android SDK 34 (API level 34)
- Kotlin 1.9.21
- JDK 17

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paceyconning/Proxmox-VE-Mobile.git
   cd Proxmox-VE-Mobile
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Sync the project with Gradle files

4. Build and run the app on your device or emulator

### Configuration

1. Launch the app and enter your Proxmox VE server details:
   - **Host**: Your Proxmox server IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
   - **Port**: Default is `8006` (or your custom port)
   - **Username**: Your Proxmox username (e.g., `root`)
   - **Password**: Your Proxmox password
   - **Realm**: Default is `pam` (or your custom realm)
   - **HTTPS**: Enable/disable based on your server configuration
2. Click "Connect to Proxmox" to authenticate
3. The dashboard will show your server status and available nodes

## Development

### Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture principles with three main layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: UI components and ViewModels
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic and use cases (planned)
- **Data Layer**: API calls and data sources

### Key Components

- **AuthenticationService**: Handles Proxmox authentication with SSL/TLS support
- **ProxmoxApiService**: Defines all API endpoints for Proxmox VE
- **ProxmoxApiClient**: Creates authenticated API service instances
- **MainViewModel**: Central state management for authentication and data
- **AppContainer**: Manual dependency injection container
- **Compose Screens**: Modern declarative UI with Material Design 3

### Current Status
